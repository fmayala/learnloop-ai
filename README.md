## Models

- Large-language model (LLMs) are available through OpenRouter and OpenAI. Support for local models is coming soon.

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run the Learnloop platform. It is recommended you use pnpm to install dependencies and run the project.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install pnpm `npm i -g pnpm`
2. Install the dependencies `pnpm install`
3. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file and set the necessary environment variables
3. Run the project `pnpm dev`

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
